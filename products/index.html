It is suitable for use in various medical settings, including anesthesiology, perioperative period, resuscitation, intensive care, and procedural sedation.

One of the key features of the MGA-06 monitor is its ability to provide long and continuous monitoring of the Brain Activity Index (AI). This allows healthcare professionals to accurately assess the depth of anesthesia and make informed decisions regarding the administration of anesthetics. By continuously monitoring the AI, the MGA-06 monitor helps to prevent over or under anesthesia, reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes.

The MGA-06 monitor also offers a range of other features that contribute to its effectiveness and usability. It has a low running cost, making it a cost-effective solution for medical institutions. The monitor is built with robust technology, ensuring its reliability and durability in demanding clinical environments. Additionally, the MGA-06 monitor has a flexible concept, thanks to its reliable clamp and built-in battery. This allows for easy installation and portability, making it a convenient monitoring tool for healthcare professionals.

To further enhance patient safety, the MGA-06 monitor can be used in conjunction with the AMG-06 Multigas Analyzer. The AMG-06 is designed for continuous noninvasive side-stream monitoring of CO2 and anesthetics concentration in inspired and expired gases. This allows healthcare professionals to accurately measure the concentration of anesthetics in the patient's breath, ensuring precise control of anesthesia levels.

In addition to monitoring CO2 and anesthetics concentration, the AMG-06 Multigas Analyzer also provides other important measurements. It determines the Respiratory Suppression Period (RSP), which helps to identify periods of reduced or absent breathing. The AMG-06 also calculates the Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) index, which is a measure of the potency of anesthetic agents. Furthermore, the device measures atmospheric pressure in operating rooms and wards, providing valuable information for anesthetic support."  >
